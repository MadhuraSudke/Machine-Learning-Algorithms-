# Simple Linear Regression From Scratch

This project implements **Simple Linear Regression from scratch using Python**, without using any machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn.

The goal is to understand:
- how linear regression works internally
- how gradient descent updates parameters
- why normalization is important
- the intuition behind fitting a straight line to data

## 📌 Problem Statement

We use a **Salary Prediction dataset** where:
- **Input (X)**: Years of Experience  
- **Output (Y)**: Salary  

The objective is to learn a linear relationship:

Y = wX + b

where:
- `w` is the weight (slope)
- `b` is the bias (intercept)

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains two columns:
- `YearsExperience`
- `Salary`

This dataset shows a clear **positive linear relationship**, making it ideal for understanding simple linear regression.

## 🧠 Intuition Behind Linear Regression

Linear regression tries to find the **best-fit straight line** that minimizes the error between:
- actual values (Y)
- predicted values (ŷ)

The model starts with random values for `w` and `b`, then gradually improves them using **Gradient Descent**.

## 📐 Cost Function (Mean Squared Error)

We use the Mean Squared Error (MSE):

J(w, b) = (1 / 2n) Σ (ŷ − y)²

This function measures how bad the predictions are.
Gradient descent minimizes this cost.

## 🔁 Gradient Descent

Gradients tell us **how to change parameters** to reduce the loss.

∂J/∂w = (1 / n) Σ (ŷ − y) x  
∂J/∂b = (1 / n) Σ (ŷ − y)

Update rules:

w = w − α ∂J/∂w  
b = b − α ∂J/∂b  

where α is the learning rate.

## 📏 Normalization (From Scratch)

To improve convergence, the input feature is normalized using **Z-score normalization**:

X_norm = (X − μ) / σ

Normalization:
- centers data around 0
- improves gradient descent stability
- speeds up convergence

---

## 📈 Results

- The loss decreases smoothly over iterations
- The learned regression line fits the data well
- The slope correctly captures the positive relationship between experience and salary
